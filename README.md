# Writing READMEs README

Udacity's course _Writing READMEs_ explains the importance of documenting your work. Here, you can find some supplemental resources for writing good READMEs.

## How to write good README

The length of your README depends on your project, some or small some are long. You need to write the essentials ! Ask yourself those three questions :

1) What steps need to be taken to install your project and be up and running ?
2) What should the user already have installed or configured ?
3) What might they have a hard time understanding right away ?

As your codebase grows you will need to reevaluate your README often to keep it updated.

## Installation or Getting started

Provide help here with any initial setup that may need to happen before using your code. If it's helpful include example code.

## Contributing

This is where you explain how the people who want to help you can do that.

## Code Status

You can also include shields that are provided by third parties and let your users now some status about your code. You need to worry about it when you will have some built test.

## License

Include a license at the end of your code is always a good idea, look in the ressources down below for a tool that can help you choose a license.
